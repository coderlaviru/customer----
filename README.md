## üß™ How the Model Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Extract key features like `AGE`, `YEARS_WITH_US`, and aggregated transaction metrics.
   - Convert dates to relevant formats and handle missing or invalid data.
   - Normalize income, transaction counts, and transaction amounts for effective modeling.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyze the distribution of customer demographics and transaction patterns.
   - Identify correlations between features like `AGE`, `YEARS_WITH_US`, and `CUS_Target`.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Combine seasonal data into comprehensive metrics (e.g., total transactions, total amounts).
   - Create categorical features for customer segmentation based on demographics and behavior.

4. **Model Training**
   - Train a classification model (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict `CUS_Target`.

5. **Evaluation**
   - Evaluate performance using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.
